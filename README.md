# Multi-Threaded Artwork

Requires g++ compiler and the SFML libraries to be installed. I made and ran this fine on my debian machine, and did the same on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine.

To install the prequisites, in your terminal on Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt install g++ libsfml-dev`

Then to compile, make sure you are in the project directory, with your terminal run `make`. Once compiled, `./bin/multi_threaded_artwork` and the program should launch.
